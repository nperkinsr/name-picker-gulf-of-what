# Name picker: The Gulf of... what?

**Name Picker: The Gulf of... what?** is a humorous twist on the classic name picker, created to practise selecting a random item from an array. Users input a list of names, then click a button to randomly choose one. But instead of a plain display, the selected name replaces the word Mexico on a map of the Gulf of Mexico, turning it into The Gulf of [Chosen Name].

This satirical project was inspired by attempts to rewrite history (looking at you, "Gulf of America"), and adds a playful, absurd edge to a basic coding exercise. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice arrays, string replacement, and DOM manipulation.
